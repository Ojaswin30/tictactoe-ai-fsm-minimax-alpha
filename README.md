# 🧠 Tic-Tac-Toe AI: FSM, Minimax & Alpha-Beta Pruning

This repository implements three AI algorithms — **Finite State Machine (FSM)**, **Minimax**, and **Alpha-Beta Pruning** — to play the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game. Each algorithm is coded independently to demonstrate different approaches to decision-making in zero-sum games.

## 📁 File Structure

- `fsm.py` – Implements a rule-based AI using a **Finite State Machine** approach  
- `minimax.py` – Implements the **Minimax** algorithm for optimal decision-making  
- `alpha_beta_pruning.py` – Enhances the minimax algorithm using **Alpha-Beta Pruning** for better efficiency

## 🎮 How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Clone the repository and run any of the scripts:

```bash
python fsm.py
python minimax.py
python alpha_beta_pruning.py
